Release Notes for te-common 2.0-Beta2 (June 7, 2003)
====================================================

This is the initial release of the SourceForge hosted codebase.

The 2.0-Beta2 release includes both binary and source versions of the
project.  Also included with each of the distribution files should
have been a copy of the software LICENSE.


Using the Binary Release
------------------------

In order to use the binary distribution, simply include all of the JAR
files in the lib directory in your environment's CLASSPATH.  This is
the only requirement to use the code.  No other configuration should
be necessary.


Building the Source Release
---------------------------

Building from the source distribution requires the Jakarta Ant build
utility.  Ant is freely available and may be downloaded from
http://jakarta.apache.org/ant.  Once Ant is downloaded and installed,
the project may be built by executing the following command:

Unix:

	$ ant

Windows:

	C:\te-common-2.0-Beta2> ant

Once the project has been built, it may be used by following the
instructions in the 'Using the Binary Release' section.


Reporting Bugs
--------------

Bugs and other problems may be directed to the te-code-users mailing
list hosted on SourceForge.


Latest Releases
---------------

The latest version of the code is always available via SourceForge's
anonymous CVS facilities.  Information on accessing the project source
code can be found at http://te-code.sourceforge.net.
