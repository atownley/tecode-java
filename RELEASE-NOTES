Release Notes for te-common 3.0-pre1
====================================================

This is the first pre-release version of the new 3.0 codebase.  There
are a number of differences between the 2.0-Beta2 (which was the last
public release) and the 3.0 release.

There were unofficial releases where are currently used in at least
three very large commercial projects, but I didn't want to release
it to the world until I was sure the API was stable and that I was
happy with the way things were going.

The highlights of differences are:

General:

* Provide i18n support for all user-visible strings
* JUnit unit tests
* Clover code coverage

Build System:

* Automatic version stamping of the builds
* Support for official and developer version builds
* Better source and binary distribution packages

com.townleyenterprises.common:

* Replacement of the AppConfig and ConfigSupplier classes with classes
  in the config package
* Added path manipulation utility class
* Generalized resource management for strings, messages and icons

com.townleyenterprises.command:

* Added abstract and default implementations of the CommandListener
  interface to reduce the amount of boilerplate code for a CLI
* Added joined, delimited and POSIX command option parsing
* Added execute method to the CommandOption to make it fully implement
  the GoF Command pattern
* Added command option constraints to further reduce boilerplate code
* Added support for preamble and postamble messages to the autohelp

com.townleyenterprises.filter:

* Added generic string filter class

com.townleyenterprises.io:

* Added generic text file utility parsing classes

com.townleyenterprises.persistence:

* Eliminated the dependencies on a pre-release version of Jaxor
* Provide backwards-compatible persistence classes for previous Jaxor
  snapshots
* Added generic ConnectionFactory interface
* Added generic configuration handling for common options

com.townleyenterprises.swing:

* Added a number of common classes:  Monitored task, about box, status
  bar, resource UI builder
* Property-based Swing themes which go beyond the standard MetalTheme
  capabilities

com.townleyenterprises.tool:

* Added example tool which is useful for generating classpath
  environment variables under Windows

com.townleyenterprises.validator:

* Added generic validator capabilites which provide more control
  than those present in the Jakarta Commons Validator package.

Using the Binary Release
------------------------

In order to use the binary distribution, simply include all of the JAR
files in the lib directory in your environment's CLASSPATH.  This is
the only requirement to use the code.  No other configuration should
be necessary.


Building the Source Release
---------------------------

Building from the source distribution requires the Jakarta Ant build
utility.  Ant is freely available and may be downloaded from
http://jakarta.apache.org/ant.  Once Ant is downloaded and installed,
the project may be built by executing the following command:

Unix:

	$ ant

Windows:

	C:\te-common-3.0-pre1> ant

Once the project has been built, it may be used by following the
instructions in the 'Using the Binary Release' section.


Reporting Bugs
--------------

Bugs and other problems may be directed to the te-code-users mailing
list hosted on SourceForge.


Latest Releases
---------------

The latest version of the code is always available via SourceForge's
anonymous CVS facilities.  Information on accessing the project source
code can be found at http://te-code.sourceforge.net.
