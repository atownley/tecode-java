========================

* Merge in the changes to the command line parser from the .NET
  edition.

* Merge in the config stuff from the .NET edition.

* General testing and bug fixes/clean-ups for 3.0 Release

* Add more support files to the distribution

* Fix the semantics of the events and the listeners to conform

* Check thread safety of all of the classes and document
  accordingly

com.townleyenterprises.command Package

* Fix the CommandParser so that it understands more of the
  relationships between arguments.  There's still too much
  effort spent to check for conflicting arguments.  Also
  should be a way to figure out how to better handle
  arguments which can be used alone or with other arguments.

* Support combined and single-dash arguments

* Provide alternate streams for error and output to ease
  testing of error and output messages

* Provide a way to support plugable handlers for error and
  output operations to ease testing and provide more flexibility.

* Provide i18n support

* Provide suppot for grouping sets of options for a single
  CommandListener.

com.townleyenterprises.common Package

* Clean up the documentation (what little there is)

* Refactor the AppConfig class so that it can support multiple
  applications running in the same JVM (say, like a web container).

com.townleyenterprises.persistence Package

* Figure out how to really make the SQLFilterAdapter work
  the way it is supposed to.  At the moment, it can generate
  SQL, but doesn't generate *useful* SQL.

com.townleyenterprises.swing Package

* Make the ResourceLoader aware of Locales so that specific
  ones can be loaded
