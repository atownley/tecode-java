TODO Items for te-common
========================

* General testing and bug fixes/clean-ups for 2.0 Release

* Add more support files to the distribution

com.townleyenterprises.command Package

* Fix the CommandParser so that it understands more of the
  relationships between arguments.  There's still too much
  effort spent to check for conflicting arguments.  Also
  should be a way to figure out how to better handle
  arguments which can be used alone or with other arguments.

* Support combined and single-dash arguments

* Explicitly support preamble and postamble arbitrary text
  blocks a la getopt

* Support default argument values correctly

com.townleyenterprises.common Package

* Clean up the documentation (what little there is)

com.townleyenterprises.persistence Package

* Figure out how to really make the SQLFilterAdapter work
  the way it is supposed to.  At the moment, it can generate
  SQL, but doesn't generate *useful* SQL.
