<p>
This class provides a generic filter mechanism for the
system.
</p>

<h3>
Concepts
</h3>
<p>
Filtering is a fairly straightforward concept.  Given a
collection of objects, iterate over the collections and
determine based on specific filter criteria if the specific
object should be included or discarded.
</p>

<h3>
Collection Filters
</h3>
<p>
This package supports different types of filtering, depending on
where the filtering should occur.  The first, and simplest,
type of filter allows the user to simply provide a class
that implements the Filter interface and provides a specific
test.  For example, given an List containing String objects,
the following code can be used to apply the filter to the
objects in the list by using the FilteredIterator Decorator.
In this case, we only want to see strings that start with
the literal "filterme":

<pre>
	Iterator collIterator = stringList.iterator();
	FilteredIterator fi = new FilteredIterator(collIterator,
		new Filter {
			public boolean doFilter(Object o)
			{
				if(!(o instanceof String))
					return false;

				String s = (String)o;
				return s.startsWith("filterme");
			}
		});
	
	// print our strings
	while(fi.hasNext())
		System.out.println(fi.next());
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This mechansim is simple to use and very powerful, but
sometimes more complex filtering is necessary.  In this
case, the package provides several pre-defined filters to
implement logical comparisons.  For example, if the
application had predefined filters to work on a specific
type of object, to find all the objects within a given
collection where filter1 and filter2 were true, something
like the following would be used:

<pre>
	// filter1, filter2 are defined earlier
	Iterator collIterator = stringList.iterator();
	FilteredIterator fi = new FilteredIterator(collIterator,
		new LogicalAndFilter ( new Object[]{filter1, filter2} );
	
	while(fi.hasNext())
		System.out.println(fi.next());
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The above code uses the array constructor of the
LogicalAndFilter class to specify that only objects where
<em>filter1.doFilter(obj) == true && filter2.doFilter(obj) == true</em> should be
printed.  There are also logical filter classes to perform
logical OR and logical NOT operations.  All of these can be
combined to perform fairly complex filters which are
dynamically defined during the execution of the application.
</p>

<h3>
Persistence Filters
</h3>

<p>
Persistence filters, as their name implies, are applied to
the persistence layer rather than to the in-memory
collections returned from a persistence layer or otherwise
created during the execution of an application.  By their
very nature, peristence filters are more complicated than
their in-memory counterparts.
