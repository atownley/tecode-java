capabilities which are compatible with the standard Java
collections.

<h3>
<a name="Concepts">
Concepts
</a>
</h3>
<p>
Filtering is a fairly straightforward concept.  Given a
collection of objects, iterate over the collection and
determine if the specific object should be included or
discarded based on specific filter criteria.
</p>
<p>
Sorting is also pretty straightforward.  Given an ordered
collection of objects, reorder the objects such that each
one is relative to the others based on specific criteria.
The Java collections already support basic sorting via the
<code>java.lang.Comparable</code> and
<code>java.util.Comparator</code> interfaces.  This package
provides a way to dynamically order collections without
actually writing the comparison routines, based on the
values of given object properties.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="CollectionFilters">
Collection Filters
</a>
</h3>
<p>
This package supports different types of filtering, depending on
where the filtering should occur.  The first, and simplest,
type of filter allows the user to provide a class implementing
the Filter interface to provide a specific, hard-coded test.
</p>
<p>
For example, given a List instance containing String
instances, the application would like to only display those
strings which start with the literal 'filterme'.  While the
{@link com.townleyenterprises.filter.Filters} class provides
a static method to encapsulate the details, an alternate
solution to the problem could be provided by the following
code:

<pre>
	Iterator collIterator = stringList.iterator();
	FilteredIterator fi = new FilteredIterator(collIterator,
		new Filter() {
			public boolean doFilter(Object o)
			{
				if(!(o instanceof String))
					return false;

				String s = (String)o;
				return s.startsWith("filterme");
			}
		});
	
	// print our strings
	while(fi.hasNext())
		System.out.println(fi.next());

</pre>
<center><strong><em>Example 1:  A Simple Filter</em></strong></center>
</p>

<p>
The mechanics of applying the filter are encapsulated in the
{@link com.townleyenterprises.filter.FilteredIterator}
instance which is used to provide a Decorator or Wrapper for
a standard Java Iterator instance.  Internally, the
<code>FilteredIterator</code> is accessing the next element
and applying the filter.  If the filter succeeds, the
element is returned when the user of the iterator calls the
<code>next</code> method.
</p>

<p>
The full power of the filtering mechanism in the package
comes from the various logical filters.  Using
combinations of the AND, OR and NOT filters, complicated
expression parse trees may be created and applied as easily
as the simple filter shown in Example 1.
</p>

<p>
To apply the logical filters to a collection of user defined
objects in order to select only a part of the collection,
the same procedure is employed as for the simple filters.
This approach is illustrated in Example 2 below:

<pre>
	// filter1 and filter2 are defined earlier
	LogicalAndFilter and = new LogicalAndFilter();
	and.addFilter(filter1);
	and.addFilter(filter2);
	FilteredIterator fi = new FilteredIterator(list.iterator(), and);

	while(fi.hasNext())
		System.out.println(fi.next());

</pre>
<center><strong><em>Example 2:  Applying Logical Filters</em></strong></center>
</p>

<p>
In Example 2, only those objects in the collection where
both filter1 and filter2 return true will be printed.  The
logical OR filter is equivalent in setup and use to the
logical AND filter, but it will include objects in the
results if either filter evaluates true.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="DynamicFilters">
Dynamic Filters
</a>
</h3>

<p>
The filters described in Example 1 and Example 2 are tightly
bound to the application in which they are used.  The filter
implementation must know the underlying structure of the
objects so that it can perform the filtering.  This approach
is not always desirable for general use selections such as a
string property being equal to another.  For this reason,
the package provides an implementation of the QueryObject
design pattern to address these general cases.
</p>

<p>
The dynamic filters rely heavily on the java.lang.Comparable
interface and can only be used with classes which implement
it.  Fortunately, all of the interesting types in the J2SDK
implement it, so it works automatically with all of the
primitive and built in wrappers for the primitive types.
The {@link com.townleyenterprises.filter.QueryFilter} class
can be used for all but substring searches if exact matches
are required.  For example, given a custom class with
properties <code>code</code> and <code>value</code>, to find
all of the objects which had a code of <code>'EUR'</code>
and values of less than 1000.00, a filter could be created
and applied to the collection as illustrated in Example 3.

<pre>
	QueryFilter code = new QueryFilter(Widget.class,
				"code", QueryOperator.EQ, "EUR");
	QueryFilter value = new QueryFilter(Widget.class,
				"value", QueryOperator.LT,
				new BigDecimal("1000.00"));
	LogicalAndFilter and = new LogicalAndFilter();
	and.addFilter(code);
	and.addFilter(value);

	Collection widgets = Filters.filter(list, and);

</pre>
<center><strong><em>Example 3:  Using Dynamic Filters</em></strong></center>
</p>

<p>
The resulting collection of widgets would all have currency
codes of 'EUR' and have values of less than 1000.00.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="Sorting">
Sorting
</a>
</h3>

<p>
Sorting is often used in conjunction with filtering, but the
sorting facilities do not depend on the filtering
mechanisms.  Like the <code>QueryFilter</code>, the {@link
com.townleyenterprises.filter.PropertySorter} class depends
on the underlying objects implementing the
<code>java.lang.Comparable</code> interface.  Like the
<code>QueryFilter</code>, the <code>PropertySorter</code>
automatically works with any of the base types provided by
the Java language.
</p>

<p>
An example of using the sorting facilities outside of
filtering would be when working with a Java Swing table
whose underlying table model is represented by a list of
custom objects.  For simplicity, take the Widget class used
for Example 3.  If the Widget instances were displayed in a
sortable table. The available properties are <code>Stock
No</code>, <code>Description</code>, <code>Quantity</code>
and <code>Color</code> in addition to the <code>Code</code>
and <code>Value</code> from above.  In order to sort the
columns to see which ones should be discounted, the
following code could be used:

<pre>
	// define the sort so we can se the largest quantity
	// on hand at the top of the list

	SortSpecification[] sort = {
		new SortSpecification("quantity", SortOrder.DESCENDING),
		new SortSpecification("description"),
		new SortSpecification("code"),
		new SortSpecification("value")
	};

	Collections.sort(tableData, new PropertySorter(Widget.class, sort));

</pre>
<center><strong><em>Example 4:  Sorting Collections</em></strong></center>
</p>

<p>
Additionally, filtering and sorting can be done at the same
time using the static {@link com.townleyenterprises.filter.Filters}
utility class.  To combine Examples 3 and 4, only the
following changes would need to be made:

<pre>
	QueryFilter code = new QueryFilter(Widget.class,
				"code", QueryOperator.EQ, "EUR");
	QueryFilter value = new QueryFilter(Widget.class,
				"value", QueryOperator.LT,
				new BigDecimal("1000.00"));
	LogicalAndFilter and = new LogicalAndFilter();
	and.addFilter(code);
	and.addFilter(value);

	// define the sort so we can se the largest quantity
	// on hand at the top of the list

	SortSpecification[] sort = {
		new SortSpecification("quantity", SortOrder.DESCENDING),
		new SortSpecification("description"),
		new SortSpecification("code"),
		new SortSpecification("value")
	};

	List widgets = Filters.filter(list, and, sort);

</pre>

<h3>
<a name="Limitations">
Limitations
</a>
</h3>

<p>
At the present time, the following limitations/issues are
present in the package:

<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of support for nested properties</strong>
-- There is currently no way to perform filtering or sorting
based on "nested" property values of the property accessor
returns an object.  A suitable object for comparison must be
supplied.  This feature will be present in a future release.
</li>
</ul>
