sFileArgs=FILE...
smkcpbatExtraHelpTextPreamble=This utility is used to automatically generate the necessary commands to set the classpath on DOS/Windows.  No easy way exists to do this without doing a lot of cut-n-paste, so this utility makes Java development a little easier if you must do it with DOS/Windows.
smkcpbatExtraHelpTextPostamble=Examples:\n  mkcpbat --outfile buildcp.bat lib\\*.jar\n  mkcpbat lib\\*.jar > buildcp.bat\n\nBoth of the above examples will create an executable batch file with appropriate 'SET CLASSPATH=' commands for all the jar files in the specified list of files.\n\nCopyright 2004, Andrew S. Townley.\nAll Rights Reserved.\nReport bugs to <te-code-users@sourceforge.net>.
