	* java/com/townleyenterprises/swing/AbstractMonitoredTask.java

	  java/com/townleyenterprises/swing/ResourceUIBuilder.java
	  java/com/townleyenterprises/swing/UIBuilder.java

	  mechanisms in the JFC demo Notepad.

	* java/com/townleyenterprises/swing/ResourceLoader.java
	  java/com/townleyenterprises/swing/ResourceProvider.java

2003-06-08 Andrew S. Townley <atownley>

	* java/com/townleyenterprises/filter/package.html

	  Updated the JavaDoc for the package to actually
	  reflect reality and put in some more appropriate
	  examples.

	* java/com/townleyenterprises/command/CommandParser.java

	  Fixed several small bugs with supporting only
	  options with short versions, printing usage for
	  obscenely long description text.

	  Changed behavior on unknown options or other
	  problems detected by the parser to use usage
	  method rather than help to reduce the output in
	  these cases.

	  Added mechanism to force CommandParser to exit on
	  error if an option requiring a value was missing
	  an argument.

	* java/com/townleyenterprises/command/RepeatableCommandOption.java
	  java/com/townleyenterprises/command/DelimitedCommandOption.java

	  Actually implemented real versions of these based
	  on further thinking after writing the examples for
	  the site.  The delimited one was necessary for
	  easily migrating some existing work.
	
	* java/com/townleyenterprises/filter/StringFilter.java
	  java/com/townleyenterprises/filter/SubstringFilter.java

	  Added StringFilter to deal with case sensitivity.
	  Changed SubstringFilter to be derived from
	  StringFilter to also deal with case insensitive
	  searches.

	  Fixed potential bugs in the way properties were
	  being checked if any of the values were null.

	* java/com/townleyenterprises/filter/Logical*Filter.java
	  java/com/townleyenterprises/filter/QueryFilter.java

	  Added toString() implementations so that they
	  could be printed for debugging.

	* java/com/townleyenterprises/common/PropertyProxy.java

	  Renamed getProxyClass method to getSubjectClass
	  since you're getting the class of the thing being
	  proxied, not the proxy proper.

2003-06-07 Andrew S. Townley <atownley@sourceforge.net>

	*  2.0-Beta2 initial code release via SourceForge
