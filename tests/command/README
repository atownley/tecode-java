README for the Command Parser Tests
===================================

This directory contains a set of external driver tests which verify
the behavior of the Java command parser exit conditions.  The normal,
unit tests are written in JUnit, but they cannot deal with all of the
exit conditions very easily.

Therefore, to ensure that I'm not breaking compatibility, a full
validation of the command parser will include execution of the
regression tests in this directory as well.

To run the tests in this directory, you need Ruby >= 1.8.2 and my
FunctionalQA module for Ruby which is available from anonymous CVS
under te-code/functionalqa.
